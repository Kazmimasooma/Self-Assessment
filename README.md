# Self-Assessment

## My Role in the Team: 

My role in the team was to be in charge of the repository's setup. This involves giving the repository a name and adding members to the team. Once everyone on the team has signed up, it was my job to make sure everyone has their own branch to work from. I was also in charge of readme and collecting data from everyone and establishing decent and presentable readme. 

## Personal Challenge: 

I dont think so there was anything challenging becuase everything we did in the group anaylsis, was done before in the class modules. But personally the challenge I faced was to keep up with the team work. Telling and asking everyone to update thier parts, collecting data and managing time with everyone so we can discuss the project detials and outcomes. 

## Team Strength: 

Our biggest team strength was our communication skills, understanding each other needs and area of expertise. If someone is falling behind and do not understand anything. Everyone was their to help and step ahead to support that perosn. I would say I got an amazing team. 

## Summary of the project: 

How can Disney movie clusters assist us in making educated judgments for other Disney company verticals?
K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbor
We can determine the closest neighbours of each movie title. We may then use this knowledge in other business sectors for toy production, merchandising product placements, park ride positioning inside Disneyland, future franchise partnership and collaborations, and so on.
